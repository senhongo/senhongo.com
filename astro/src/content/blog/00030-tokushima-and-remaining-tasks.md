Last week was the Obon holidays in Japan, so I decided to take some well needed time off away from [Chubic] as I was starting to feel quite burnt out and unable to focus.

It was a good week. I drove from Nagano to Fukui to check out the [dino museum], down to Tokushima to meet Marco from [Studio AKARI] and Kan-chan from [WEEK], then towards Kobe to meet painters [Masa Hida] and [Munehiro Yoshimura]. While in Tokushima, I drove around several fishing villages along the southeastern coast of Anan and saw the pacific ocean. I spent at least 2 hours doing nothing, just gazing in to the horizon. It's amazing and I'm sad that I lack the words to describe the emotions I felt.

I love looking at large, empty horizons and this was exactly what I came here for.

It was a physically gruelling week especially from all that summer heat. But mentally it was amazing. I cannot overstate how much my mind has cleared up and how much more mental clarity I have now. Before, my mind would just keep going in circles around subjects, I would lack the patience required to focus or think about anything that required more than a few minutes. I kept escaping to reading mangas or watching anime, anything that would take the load off my mind and let me just be a zombie.

After coming back from the trip, I feel so much more motivated to get back to work. I was reviewing several PRs and found it so much easier to understand the changes. This was definitely a well needed break.

Now, I had planned to 'complete' the redesign of [this blog] as well as start working on the landing page for [Millefeuille.app] during this little trip.

Spoilers, I didn't.

This post started off as a to do list for the blog, but I think I'll just end it here.
