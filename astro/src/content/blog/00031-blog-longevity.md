Quick, random thoughts, inspired by this article: [Making a blog for the next 10 years].

I've had this blog in one manner or another since at least 2016. Previous articles did not survive the transition to the current iteration, but anyway.

Assuming I would like this blog to last the remainder of my lifespan. It would have to survive multiple technological changes.

It? What do you mean 'It'?

The _content_ would have to survive multiple shifts in technologies. That's why when I started working on the original iteration back in 2016, I chose to use a static site generator and store my content in markdown, and also why I've resisted moving to [MDX] which seems to be popular among many other JS-framework blogs. The current version of this blog is built using [Next.js]. Before that it was [Hugo], and before that it was [Wintersmith], and before that it was a couple of [gulp] scripts. Remember _that_?

My markdown articles has survived all those transitions. Well, not really, because I deleted them before launching this blog. But the concept of using markdown has survived. The markdown language has also evolved into something called [CommonMark].

What about the blog itself? How long will I continue building it with [Next.js] and deploying it with [Cloudflare]?

While planning the redesign, I did seriously consider switch back to [Hugo], or to something different like [11ty] or [Astro]. I stucked with [Next.js] because the priority was/is to get it done ASAP so I could focus on [Millefeuille] and [Chubic] instead. The code for the blog already exists and works, and I could focus on 'just' designing it.

Maybe when I'm retired from my future riches, I'll switch to back to a more pure SSG like [Hugo] or whatever comes of it. Or write my own.
