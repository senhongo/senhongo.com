## What I did

Goal of this cycle is to update the design of this blog and code as much of the new components as possible. Of these, I managed to

- complete the basic design updates
- added and implemented a new colour palette
- created a couple of responsive grids using CSS grid
- updated the header nav contents and made it responsive

## What I learned

A responsive grid is surprisingly easier than I thought it would be.

A 12 col grid wrapper was also easy to implement and I didn't find any actual use for it. Using it meant going back to the old ways of designign elements to fit into 12 columns. It also mean that the various elements had to specifically slot into those specific columns.

It was easier to have a simple grid that expanded and contracted as needed, or just plain old flexbox.

I forgot about this one but I probably also want to update the typography, particularly the font sizes and weights. I'm using system fonts now and don't particularly feel like changing that yet. Let's think about that next cycle.

### Possible schedule conflicts

Marketing Week 3 is supposed to begin 27th April and last till 3rd May, but I will be travelling to Tokyo the week after that. That's Dev Week 4.

I don't really want to dev when travelling so I may either make extend either DW3 or MW3 to 2 weeks. I'll decide at the end of DW3.
