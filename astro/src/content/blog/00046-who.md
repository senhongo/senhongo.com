_(I wrote this draft a month ago but decided to publish it today because why not?)_

Me, obviously. For all possible iterations and view points of the question, this blog is for me.

I am my own target audience.

I write it for my own benefit.

I don't know if I'll ever finish this draft. I'm not quite sure what the point of this blog was.

It started by reading this [HN Thread] about another dev blogging about the tech they used to build their blog. But it was sparked by a top level comment by pembrook with this interesting comment.

> Great stuff, looking forward to your next blog post in 1 year: “How I rebuilt my blog on…”
>
> A fun hobby of mine is Googling “how I built this blog with [next.js/Gatsby/etc etc]” and going to page 10 of the Google results.
>
> It’s just hundreds of developer blogs with no blog posts other than the ones announcing how the blog was built.

Anyone the draft is written, then I took a nap. I'm happy for now.
