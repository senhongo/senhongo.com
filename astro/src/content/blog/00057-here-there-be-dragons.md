As of today, I am no longer a member of the [Chubic] team.

I have learnt much during the past four years. There were so many things we set out to do, so much I personally wanted to get done but couldn't for lack of time or skill. I wish there was more I could contribute, I still have so many ideas that haven't had the chance to see the light of day.

But I am spent.

Now I will [rest].

## What comes next?

I don't have any concrete plans or a schedule. The next couple of weeks will be focused purely on just chilling out and recharging my batteries. Maybe I can finally get around to doing the Infinity Wars marathon that I've wanted to do for so long now.

After that, I would like to get back to working on [Millefeuille].

This, I actually have plans and all that, but I might want to re-think it a little bit. The plans were initially created for what was a side project that was worked on for maybe an hour a day or less. If I were to dedicate the coming year to Millefeuille, I want to be a little bit more ambitious.
