It's been two weeks into the beginning of my sabbatical and I'm feeling restless.

I haven't done much since. First my wife got covid, then it was my turn. So either one of us was bed ridden and we isolated at home for most of that time. We got around to the first Avengers movie on Friday night though, can't wait for phase 2!

One benefit of being bed-ridden was that I've had a lot of time to think. I was delirious for a good part of it, but thinking is thinking. One topic I kept coming back to was goals. What would my next goal be? I want to build my own product, but what is the final outcome from that?

I have no answers though I have come to the realisation that money does not motivate me anymore. That was a little surprising.

What I'm seeking now is time. Specifically, the freedom to spend time on things dear to me. Spending time with my loved ones, or focusing on my health, hobbies and interests.

It also means that I can spend a year (or two) bootstrapping [Millefeuille]. Maybe I'll go work as a liftie at the local ski resort even! Looking forward to the next season. I finally have a real chance of hitting 100 days on the slopes this time 🏂
