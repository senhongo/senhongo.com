I've finally got around to building my website. As you can see, it's still quite sparse. I plan to document the design and build as I go.

Progress will probably be slow.

## Let's quickly talk about the tech stack.

Previous versions of this website were built using static site generators like [Jekyll], [Wintersmith], [Hugo], etc. Probably more but these were the ones I remembered. These all failed for various reasons: lack of skill, lack of motivation, insufferable documentation, lack of planning.

> This time it's different!™

This time, I'm using [Next.js], something I'm already using everyday at `$DAY_JOB`. I've also separated my tasks where instead of designing and coding all at once, I started off with a basic design before even typing `git init`.

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) seems to be popular for Next.js based blogs but I've decided to stick with plain markdown to keep a clear separation of concerns between code and content.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is where I'm currently hosting this. I might move it elsewhere later once it's more developed.

Everything else is still in flux. One thing at a time.

See you again! 👋
