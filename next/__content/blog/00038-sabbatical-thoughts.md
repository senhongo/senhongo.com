Not really going on a sabbatical but I get these thoughts frequently so I want to write it down and get it out of my system.

For several years now, I’ve always fantasised about taking a year off of doing client work to focus on doing my own stuff. Yes, I still want to do stuff. I’m not taking a holiday, I’m talking about setting aside time to focus on my self growth.

## When?

Probably when I leave the [Chubic] team.

It would be interesting to have time to focus on building [Millefeuille]. It’ll give me the opportunity to brush up or explore skills that I don’t get to use at [Chubic].

## What about money?

Yes, that will be an issue. I have savings but I’ll need to reduce my expenses.

## Previous experience

I took a 6 month sabbatical once back in 2014 after completing a major project. I say sabbatical but it was more of a holiday really. I spent the whole time playing games, travelling around the Kansai area, visiting old friends and making some new friends. I did have plans to learn some new tech and build a product but I was terribly burnt out and just wanted to unwind and explore Japan.

## Conclusion

This, was surprisingly shorter than I expected. I had a lot of thoughts swirling around in my mind but as I started writing things down, I realised it was mostly the same ideas expressed in slightly different ways.

Honestly, I've actually gotten more excited over the idea of going on a sabbatical after writing this down.

But I won't. Exciting things are going on at [Chubic] and I don't want to get left out. Maybe in a couple years time.
