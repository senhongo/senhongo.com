It's surprising how busy life can be even without (paying) work.

A lot of time was spent working on my small piece of land, mainly clearing weeds that I've let grown into a real problem. We had a stinkbug infestation about 2 years ago and I think all the overgrowth was a factor. It provided lots of food and cover for the bugs to grow, and they would get into the various little nooks and crannies during the autumn and winter months.

I've been snowboarding a lot since the snow started falling. I've always wanted to try achieving 100 days on the slopes though I'm not sure if I can hit that goal. January is almost over and I've only done 21 days. Also, one of my favourite boards, the 1st gen. Burton Deepthinker delaminated itself so I'm riding just the Korua Dart now. I enjoy it and it's really great for carving but I missing riding switch. Not bad for a board that's 7-8 years old I guess.

Speaking of gear wearing out, my Nitro Team boots is wearing out too. The rear edge of the right sole is peeling off. I've tried fixing it with epoxy but another part of the sole just peels off. I don't remember how old this one is but it's probably 4 or 5 years old. That's easily over 150-200 days. I replaced it with a pair of Ride Lasso Pros.

Where was I? I'm literally just writing this as my thoughts flow.

Ok so I've been working on my home, then snowboarding.

I tried to get back to working on Millefeuille back in November. Spent some time with Claude to see what it could do, and I admit that the code it can produce is impressive. My main issue is that it keeps trying to drive me towards building a typical accounting app, which Millefeuille isn't.

Anyway, I'd like to get back to working on Millefeuille again but first, I want to 'finish' the blog. The redesign is done but there are still a few features that are missing, tags for one. I had also planned to migrate over to Astro.

So my immediate plans are snowboard and work on the blog.
